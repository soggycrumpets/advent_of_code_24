Here's one idea:
First, calculate all of the possibilities that produce the minimum number of keypad presses for the numerical keypad.
For each of these, calculate all of the possibilities that produce the minimum number of keypad presses for the next directional keypad.
Then, do the same thing for each of THOSE possibilities.

Here's an interesting idea... We don't actually need to check all of the possibilities once we hit the third and final keypad.
    At this point, we don't need to find ALL of the shortest sequences. We only need to find ONE. And this is something that should
    be doable consistently in only one pass.
